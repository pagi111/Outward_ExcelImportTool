# OutwardEnhanced_ExcelImportTool
C# GUI app that facilitates the mod-making process for Outward. It reads through the Excel file that contains modded stats for weapons in the game (an example file is attached to the repository, but of course you can modify it), imports data from it and exports it by creating text files that the game can use.
